# Personalized PageRank Graph Neural Networks (PPRGNN) — Reimplementation & Review

This repository contains the final project for the *Linear Algebra Applications in Data Mining* course, in which we reviewed and re-implemented the **Personalized PageRank Graph Neural Network (PPRGNN)** model. Alongside the official architecture, we provide a detailed analysis of the method, additional mathematical preliminaries, and a Persian-language report summarizing our findings.

## **Project Overview**

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from oversmoothing and limited long-range information propagation. The PPRGNN framework addresses these challenges by integrating **Personalized PageRank (PPR)** into the message-passing process, enabling controlled and theoretically grounded neighborhood aggregation.

In this project, we:

* **Reviewed the original PPRGNN paper**, including motivation, architecture, theoretical foundations, and experimental results.
* **Re-implemented PPRGNN** from scratch, following the original formulation and comparing it with baselines.
* **Added extra preliminaries** to improve clarity—covering PageRank, graph Laplacians, spectral filtering, and the relationship between diffusion processes and GNNs.
* **Wrote a comprehensive Persian report**, summarizing:

  * theoretical background
  * full explanation of PPRGNN
  * implementation details
  * insights, limitations, and extensions
